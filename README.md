# HackyHour Potsdam
## About
Come and talk with your peers and colleagues about your research problems related to code, data or digital tools.
If you do have a specific problem - bring it along and get help.
You can also just take a break, come by and socialize.
Every second week we cover certain topics that might be of special interest to you.

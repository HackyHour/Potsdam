# About
Come and talk with your peers and colleagues about your research problems related to code, data or digital tools.
If you do have a specific problem - bring it along and get help.
You can also just take a break, come by and socialize.
No registration needed!
Every second week we cover a particular topic that might be of special interest to you, however prior knowledge is not a prerequisite.

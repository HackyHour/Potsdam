# About
Come and talk with your peers and colleagues about your research problems related to code, data or digital tools.
If you do have a specific problem - bring it along and get help.
You can also just take a break, come by and socialize.
No registration needed!
Every second week we cover certain topics that might be of special interest to you.

# When and Where
Every Wednesday at 2pm at [Caf√© Freundlich](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.3819&mlon=13.0650#map=16/52.3819/13.0650&layers=N), Telegrafenberg, House 34, 14473 Potsdam.
